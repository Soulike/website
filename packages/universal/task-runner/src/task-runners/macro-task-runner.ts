/**
 * Task runner that executes tasks in the macro task queue for lower-priority operations.
 *
 * Use this runner for tasks that should execute in the next event loop cycle, such as:
 * - Background processing that doesn't need immediate execution
 * - Deferred cleanup operations
 * - Non-critical async operations
 * - Tasks that should not block the current execution flow
 *
 * Macro tasks have lower priority than microtasks and will execute after all microtasks
 * have completed. They're scheduled using setTimeout with 0ms delay.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { macroTaskRunner } from './macro-task-runner.js';
 *
 * // Execute a background operation
 * const result = await macroTaskRunner.push(backgroundTask);
 * ```
